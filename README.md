Description of my work.

-First I created 4 files (index.html, contact.html, portfolio.html, and style.css).

-Then I went to "Bootstrap" website and copied the link for CSS and paste it in <head>, Inside index.html.
-And, I added a link to my stylesheet "style.css" in <head>.

-Then I copied the javaScript link and paste inside <script> inside <body>.

-I searched on Bootstrap for the nav bar I found will suite my style,
and I copied it and paste it inside <body>.

-I copied all these steps and pasted it inside the other 2 "html" files (contact.html, portfolio.html).
-Then I ended the navbar.



-It's time to customize each file depends on it's content.

index.html will contain my "name" and "about me".
